A self-publishing platform that allows anyone to write, publish, and sell their own books.

## Setting Up Local Environment
The following instructions will help you set up a local development environment, run the project on your machine for development and testing purposes, and deploy it on a live system. See [*Deployment*](https://github.com/jtanaeki/PubHub-Hibernate/blob/main/README.md#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project. See [*How to Discuss and Contribute*](https://github.com/jtanaeki/PubHub#how-to-discuss-and-contribute) for notes on how to contribute to this repository.

### Prerequisites
Before building and testing the application, you must make sure to have the following installed:
- The [latest version of Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) (Using JRE 1.8, rather than JDK, maybe more suitable for this application to run on WildFly)
- Any IDE that supports JRE development, such as the [latest version of Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) (Download and install Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers)
- Application Server, such as the [latest version of WildFly](https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/) (Please read [*Java Development Environment Setup*](Java%20Development%20Environment%20Setup.pdf) to see how to integrate Wildfly with Eclipse)
- Database, such as the [latest version of PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)

For further instruction on setting up your environment for Java development, read [*Java Development Environment Setup*](Java%20Development%20Environment%20Setup.pdf).

\* *Please keep in mind that these instructions were constructed around 2016.*

### Cloning the Repository
After installing the necessary software, you can clone a local copy of the repository. A [ZIP file version](https://github.com/jtanaeki/PubHub-Hibernate/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of the copy can be downloaded, or you can clone the repository directly over HTTPS from the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtanaeki/PubHub-Hibernate.git
```

## Running the Application
The following instructions will help you get the program running via Eclipse.

### Importing the Project
- The Import function can be accessed in three ways:
  - The most convenient and quickest way: **File > Importâ€¦** (shortcut: **Alt + F + I**):

       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55217672/118418913-5e5ea300-b688-11eb-8ce7-314bf4d58332.png)<br /><br />

  - Right click on any blank space in *Package Explorer* view, select **Importâ€¦** from the context menu:

       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55217672/118419010-c90fde80-b688-11eb-8b66-e87a79240128.png)<br /><br />

  - Right click on any blank space in _Project Explorer_ view, then select **Import > Importâ€¦** from the context menu:

       ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55217672/118419021-d4fba080-b688-11eb-9536-fd28a18a5957.png)<br /><br />

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55217672/118419042-e5ac1680-b688-11eb-8fc4-791adebada69.png)<br /><br />

- Under the *General* folder, select *Existing Projects into Workspace* and click **Next**. The next screen, _Import Projects_, appears.       

- If the application was downloaded as a zip file, click _Select archive file_ and click the **Browse** button to locate the zip file. Make sure the project is selected and click **Finish**:

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55217672/118419097-0c6a4d00-b689-11eb-879d-4f1f29e1af4d.png)<br /><br />

- If the application was NOT downloaded as a zip file, click _Select root directory_ and click the **Browse** button to find the projectâ€™s directory path. Make sure the project and the *Copy projects into workspace* option is selected:

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55217672/118419200-610dc800-b689-11eb-8629-ee35afe1a925.png)<br /><br />

- The archive will be extracted and the files will be copied into the workspace. The imported project should show in the *Project Explorer/Package Explorer* view:

### Integrating the Application Server (Wildfly) with the IDE (Eclipse)
If you have not done so yet, make sure Wildfly is set up on Eclipse for deployment. Please read [*Java Development Environment Setup*](Java%20Development%20Environment%20Setup.pdf). Follow the instructions in the *Integrating Your Application Server with Your IDE (JBoss Middleware)* section.

### Setting up the Database
Please read [*Java Development Environment Setup*](Java%20Development%20Environment%20Setup.pdf) to see how to set up PostgreSQL. Follow the instructions in the *Installing a Database (PostgreSQL)* section. Create [these tables](https://github.com/jtanaeki/PubHub-Hibernate#Entity-Relational-Diagram-of-Tables-in-Database) in the database and fill in random values.
